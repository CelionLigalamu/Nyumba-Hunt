# Nyumba-Hunt

Nyumba-Hunt is a housing marketplace that allows tenants to find vacant rental houses and book them instantly without physically walking around.

Landlords can list their houses(if it is a bed-sitter,single room,one bedroom, 2 bedroom etc),location of their houses,upload photos, set prices and mark houses as Vacant or Occupied, ensuring that tenants only book houses that are truly available.

Built with Django, Bootstrap, and HTML, Nyumba-Hunt provides a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for both tenants and landlords.
